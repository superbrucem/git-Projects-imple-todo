Analyst Prompt for a Simple To-Do Application
Objective: Create a comprehensive Project Brief document for the development of a basic, single-user to-do list web application. The brief should outline all necessary components for a developer to begin building the application.

1. Project Overview
Project Title: Simple To-Do List Application

Project Goal: To create a functional, single-page web application that allows a user to manage a list of tasks. The application should be a self-contained, single HTML file with no external dependencies beyond standard browser features.

2. Key Features
The final application must include the following functionalities:

Task Addition: Users must be able to input new tasks and add them to the list.

Task Display: Tasks should be displayed in a clear, easy-to-read list.

Task Completion: Users must be able to mark a task as "complete" or "done." This should visually distinguish completed tasks from pending ones (e.g., a strikethrough).

Task Deletion: Users must be able to remove individual tasks from the list.

Data Persistence: The to-do list should be saved in the browser's localStorage so that the tasks remain on the page even after the user refreshes or closes the browser.

3. Technical Requirements
The application must be contained within a single HTML file (index.html).

All styling must be done using an internal <style> tag or inline styles.

All application logic must be written in JavaScript within a <script> tag.

The design should be simple, clean, and mobile-responsive.

4. Deliverable
The analyst will produce a detailed Project Brief document, which will include:

A clear and concise summary of the project.

A breakdown of the project's features and functionality.

A section on technical specifications and design considerations.

A user flow diagram illustrating the main interactions (e.g., adding a task, marking it complete, etc.).

A list of potential future enhancements.

This document serves as the foundation for a single-file web application and is to be used as a reference throughout the development process.
