As a developer specializing in the BmAD (Business-Driven, Model-Based, Agile Development) method, you are tasked with implementing a specific user story from the project backlog.

Instructions:

Analyze the Task: Based on the provided PRD, Architecture document, and Scrum Master's backlog, identify the specific user story you are assigned.

Break down the user story into smaller, actionable coding tasks.

Identify which components of the proposed architecture you will be working on (e.g., Model, View, Controller).

Plan the Implementation: Propose a step-by-step development plan for this user story. This plan should include:

The specific HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code structure you will use.

How you will handle data interactions, including reading from and writing to localStorage.

How you will implement the required UI changes and interactions.

Validate and Test: Outline a plan for testing your implementation. This should include:

How you will perform unit testing to ensure your code works as expected.

How you will perform acceptance testing to meet the user story's acceptance criteria.

How your implementation aligns with the non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, accessibility).
