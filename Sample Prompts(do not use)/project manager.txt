PRD Generation Prompt
You are a product manager tasked with creating a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the "Simple To-Do List Application" based on the provided Project Brief.

Your PRD should be a professional, well-structured document that includes the following sections:

1. Introduction: Briefly introduce the project's purpose and goals.

2. User Stories:  Create 3-5 concise user stories in the format "As a [type of user], I want to [action], so that [reason]." These stories should cover the core functionalities outlined in the Project Brief.

3. Functional Requirements: List and describe the specific functionalities the application must have, such as:

Task Management: Details on how tasks are added, displayed, and edited.

Data Persistence: Explain how the list will be saved and retrieved.

User Interface (UI) Requirements: Describe the expected visual and interactive elements.

4. Non-Functional Requirements: Define requirements that are not tied to a specific function but are essential for the application's performance and user experience.

Performance: How quickly should the app load and respond to user actions?

Usability: How intuitive should the interface be?

Technical Constraints: Reiterate that the application must be a single HTML file with internal CSS and JavaScript.

5. Acceptance Criteria: For each core user story or functional requirement, provide a set of specific, measurable, and testable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Use a checklist format where possible.

6. Release Plan & Scope: Define what features will be included in the initial release (V1.0) and a brief mention of potential future enhancements (e.g., user authentication, task priorities, etc.).

Your final document should be clear, detailed, and serve as the primary guide for the development and testing teams. It should transform the high-level concepts from the Project Brief into actionable, specific requirements.
