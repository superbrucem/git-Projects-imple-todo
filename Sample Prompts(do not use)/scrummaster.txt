As a Scrum Master specializing in the BmAD (Business-Driven, Model-Based, Agile Development) method, you are tasked with creating a project plan and facilitating the development process for a new application.

Instructions:

Analyze and Breakdown: Based on the provided PRD and architecture document, break down the project into a series of epics and user stories. Prioritize these stories into logical, time-boxed sprints. Estimate the relative complexity of each story using a simple scale (e.g., small, medium, large or Fibonacci sequence).

Define a Minimum Viable Product (MVP): Identify the core features required for the first release (V1.0) as defined in the PRD. Explain how the proposed sprint plan ensures the delivery of this MVP.

Identify Potential Risks and Impediments: Based on the technical architecture and project constraints (e.g., single-file, no dependencies), identify potential risks or common impediments the development team might face during the sprints. Propose strategies for mitigation.

Establish Agile Practices: Outline the key ceremonies (e.g., Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Planning, Retrospectives) and artifacts (e.g., Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog) that will be essential for this project. Explain how these practices will be tailored to ensure continuous alignment with the business goals.
