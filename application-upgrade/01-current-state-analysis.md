## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Critical Issues
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**:
   - PHP 7.4 end-of-life security risks
   - Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
   - Weak password policies
   - No multi-factor authentication

2. **Performance Problems**:
   - Slow database queries due to missing indexes
   - Large JavaScript bundles causing slow page loads
   - No caching strategy implemented
   - Inefficient file upload handling

3. **Scalability Limitations**:
   - Single server architecture
   - No horizontal scaling capability
   - Database becomes bottleneck with large datasets
   - File storage on local filesystem

### Technical Debt
- **Code Quality**: 
  - Mixed coding standards across the codebase
  - Limited test coverage (estimated 25%)
  - Monolithic architecture difficult to maintain
  - Legacy jQuery code mixed with modern patterns

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Manual deployment processes
  - No containerization
  - Limited monitoring and logging
  - Backup strategy relies on manual processes

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Measures
- Basic username/password authentication
- HTTPS enabled with valid SSL certificate
- Basic input validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control (basic implementation)

### Security Gaps
- **Authentication**: No MFA, weak password requirements
- **Authorization**: Overly permissive role assignments
- **Data Protection**: No encryption at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Limited activity tracking
- **Compliance**: Not GDPR compliant for EU users

### Vulnerability Scan Results
- **High Risk**: 8 vulnerabilities (mostly PHP/Laravel related)
- **Medium Risk**: 15 vulnerabilities (dependencies)
- **Low Risk**: 23 vulnerabilities (configuration issues)

## Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

### Current Compliance Status
- **GDPR**: Partial compliance, missing data portability
- **SOC 2**: Not compliant, no formal security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Not pursuing certification
- **Industry Standards**: Basic compliance with internal policies

### Required Improvements
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data retention and deletion policies
- Privacy controls and user consent management
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Integration Landscape

### Current Integrations
- **Email**: SMTP integration for notifications
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem storage
- **Authentication**: Internal user database only
- **Reporting**: Basic CSV export functionality

### Integration Limitations
- No API for third-party integrations
- Limited webhook support
- No SSO capabilities
- Manual data import/export processes

## Data Analysis

### Database Schema Issues
- **Normalization**: Some tables poorly normalized
- **Indexing**: Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- **Constraints**: Inconsistent foreign key constraints
- **Data Types**: Inefficient data type choices in some tables

### Data Quality
- **Completeness**: 85% of required fields populated
- **Consistency**: Some data inconsistencies across related tables
- **Accuracy**: Generally good, but some outdated user information
- **Duplicates**: Estimated 3% duplicate records

### Migration Considerations
- **Data Volume**: 12GB database, 200GB file storage
- **Downtime Requirements**: Maximum 4-hour maintenance window
- **Data Transformation**: Some schema changes will require data migration
- **Backup Strategy**: Full backup before migration, incremental during process
