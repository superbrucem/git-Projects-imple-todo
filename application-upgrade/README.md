- **Business Continuity**: Minimize disruption to ongoing operations
- **Integration Dependencies**: Existing integrations must be maintained or migrated
- **Change Management**: Significant focus on user adoption and training

### Risk Management Focus
- **Data Loss Prevention**: Critical focus on data integrity and backup strategies
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Must be able to revert to legacy system if needed
- **Parallel Operations**: Often requires running both systems simultaneously
- **User Resistance**: Managing resistance to change and ensuring adoption

### Migration-Specific Challenges
- **Technical Debt**: Addressing accumulated technical debt and outdated technologies
- **Performance Comparison**: New system must perform better than legacy
- **Feature Parity**: Ensuring all critical legacy features are preserved
- **Compliance Continuity**: Maintaining regulatory compliance during transition
