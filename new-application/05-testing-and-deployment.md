# Testing and Deployment Strategy - TaskFlow Pro

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Pyramid

#### Unit Tests (70% of tests)
- **Frontend**: React component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Backend**: Service and utility function testing with Jest
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum code coverage
- **Test Types**:
  - Component rendering and props
  - Business logic functions
  - API endpoint handlers
  - Database operations

#### Integration Tests (20% of tests)
- **API Integration**: Full request/response cycle testing
- **Database Integration**: Repository layer testing with test database
- **Third-party Services**: Mock external API interactions
- **Test Environment**: Isolated test database and services

#### End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)
- **Tool**: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Critical User Journeys**:
  - User registration and login
  - Project creation and management
  - Task creation and assignment
  - Team collaboration workflows
- **Browser Coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari

### Testing Environments

#### Development
- **Local Testing**: Jest watch mode for rapid feedback
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL instance
- **Services**: Local mock services

#### Staging
- **Environment**: Production-like setup
- **Data**: Anonymized production data subset
- **Testing**: Full regression testing before releases

#### Production
- **Monitoring**: Real-time error tracking with Sentry
- **Health Checks**: Automated endpoint monitoring
- **Performance**: Continuous performance monitoring

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint with strict rules
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage required
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning

### Review Process
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Minimum 2 reviewer approval
- **Automated Checks**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Code Standards**: Consistent formatting with Prettier
- **Documentation**: Updated documentation for new features

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Simulate 1000+ concurrent users
- **Stress Testing**: Identify breaking points
- **Database Performance**: Query optimization and indexing
- **Frontend Performance**: Lighthouse audits for each release

## Deployment Strategy

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### Continuous Integration
```yaml
Trigger: Pull Request
Steps:
1. Code checkout
2. Install dependencies
3. Run linting and type checking
4. Run unit tests
5. Run integration tests
6. Build application
7. Security scanning
8. Code coverage report
```

#### Continuous Deployment
```yaml
Trigger: Merge to main branch
Steps:
1. Run full test suite
2. Build production artifacts
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run E2E tests on staging
5. Deploy to production (if staging passes)
6. Run smoke tests on production
7. Notify team of deployment status
```

### Environment Strategy

#### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Feature development and testing
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL
- **Services**: Local or development service instances
- **Access**: All developers

#### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Database**: Staging PostgreSQL with production-like data
- **Services**: Staging instances of all services
- **Access**: Development team and stakeholders

#### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live application serving users
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL with backups
- **Services**: Production instances with monitoring
- **Access**: Limited to deployment automation and emergency access

### Deployment Process

#### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Strategy**: Maintain two identical production environments
- **Benefits**: Zero-downtime deployments and quick rollback
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy new version to inactive environment (Green)
  2. Run health checks and smoke tests
  3. Switch traffic from Blue to Green
  4. Monitor for issues
  5. Keep Blue as rollback option

#### Database Migrations
- **Strategy**: Forward-compatible migrations
- **Process**:
  1. Deploy backward-compatible schema changes
  2. Deploy application code
  3. Run data migrations if needed
  4. Clean up deprecated schema in next release

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Application Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry for real-time error monitoring
- **Performance**: AWS CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics
- **User Analytics**: Custom analytics for user behavior
- **Uptime Monitoring**: External service for availability checks

#### Alert Configuration
- **Critical Alerts**: 
  - Application errors > 1% error rate
  - Response time > 2 seconds
  - Database connection failures
- **Warning Alerts**:
  - High memory usage (>80%)
  - Disk space low (<20%)
  - Unusual traffic patterns

#### Incident Response
- **On-Call Rotation**: 24/7 coverage for critical issues
- **Escalation Process**: Clear escalation path for different severity levels
- **Runbooks**: Documented procedures for common issues
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Learning from incidents to improve reliability

### Rollback Procedures

#### Application Rollback
- **Automated**: Rollback to previous version if health checks fail
- **Manual**: Quick rollback process for critical issues
- **Database**: Separate rollback strategy for schema changes

#### Data Recovery
- **Backups**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Ability to restore to specific timestamp
- **Testing**: Regular backup restoration testing
