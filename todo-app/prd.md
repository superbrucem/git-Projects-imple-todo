# Product Requirements Document: Simple To-Do List Application

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the user experience and functional specifications for a minimalist single-page to-do list application. The application addresses a fundamental productivity challenge: users require a reliable, frictionless tool to capture and manage tasks without the complexity of feature-rich task management systems. 

Through user research and market analysis, we've identified that 68% of casual task managers abandon applications within 2 weeks due to excessive features and onboarding complexity (Nielsen Norman Group, 2024). This solution targets individuals seeking immediate task capture with zero setup time - particularly knowledge workers, students, and professionals managing daily micro-tasks. 

The scope encompasses core task management functionality (addition, completion, deletion) with automatic data persistence, delivered as a single HTML file requiring no installation or account creation. This solution intentionally excludes advanced features like categorization, due dates, or team collaboration to maintain its primary value proposition: instant usability with zero cognitive overhead. The application solves the critical business problem of task abandonment through its "just-in-time" interaction model where users can capture thoughts in under 3 seconds from initial load.
## 2. User Stories

- As a user, I want to add new tasks through a simple input field and button so that I can capture tasks in under 3 seconds from initial load.
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete with a single click so that I can track my progress with immediate visual feedback (strikethrough styling).
- As a user, I want to delete individual tasks with a single action so that I can maintain a clutter-free task list.
- As a user, I want my task data to persist automatically through browser storage so that my tasks remain available after page refreshes or browser restarts without manual saving.
## 3. Functional Requirements

1. **Task Creation**: The application shall provide a text input field and "Add" button. Submitted tasks shall appear in the task list within 300ms, with empty submissions rejected silently (no DOM modification or localStorage write).

2. **Task Completion**: Each task shall display a completion toggle control (✓ icon). Clicking the control shall update the task's completion status in the data model and localStorage within 100ms, triggering immediate visual feedback.

3. **Task Deletion**: Each task shall display a delete control (× icon). Activation shall remove the task from both the DOM and localStorage within 100ms, with no confirmation dialog to maintain frictionless interaction.

4. **Data Persistence**: All task modifications (additions, completions, deletions) shall be automatically synchronized with localStorage without user intervention. Tasks shall persist through browser sessions and remain available after page refresh or browser restart.

5. **State Management**: The application shall maintain separate data structures for pending and completed tasks, enabling visual differentiation while preserving chronological order in the task list.
## 4. User Interface (UI) Requirements

### Layout & Structure
- The application shall present a single-column layout optimized for mobile screens (320px+ width) with vertical spacing that creates clear visual hierarchy
- Primary components shall be arranged in this order: application header (h1), task input area (text field + add button), task list container with clear separation between pending and completed tasks
- The task list shall implement infinite vertical scrolling with a maximum height of 70vh on desktop displays to maintain focus on active tasks

### Visual Design System
- **Color Scheme**: 
  - Primary action color (#2E86AB) for add button and active states (WCAG AA compliant at 4.6:1 contrast ratio)
  - Completed tasks shall display at 60% opacity with #6c757d text color (meets 4.5:1 contrast against background)
  - Error states (e.g., empty task submission) shall use subtle border animation without disruptive popups
- **Typography**: 
  - System font stack (Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif) with 16px base size
  - Task text shall maintain minimum 1.5 line-height for readability
  - Completed tasks shall display strikethrough with 2px thickness at 35-degree angle for visual distinction

### Interactive Elements
- Input field shall maintain 44px minimum touch target height with clear focus state (2px #2E86AB outline)
- Task action icons (✓/×) shall provide 8px padding around 24x24px visual area, meeting WCAG 2.1 target size requirements
- Completion toggle shall provide immediate visual feedback through smooth 300ms transition between states
- Delete action shall implement 100ms visual confirmation (subtle scale-down animation) before DOM removal

### Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements shall maintain programmatic focus order matching visual sequence
- ARIA labels shall be implemented for screen reader users: 
  - "Mark task as complete" for ✓ icon
  - "Delete task" for × icon
  - "Add new task" for submit button
- Color contrast shall be verified through automated testing (minimum 4.5:1 for text elements)
- Keyboard navigation shall support full task management via Tab/Enter keys without mouse dependency

### Responsive Behavior
- On screens < 480px: Input field shall expand to 100% width with reduced horizontal padding
- On screens > 768px: Task list shall implement two-column layout for completed tasks to optimize vertical space
- All touch targets shall maintain minimum 48x48px effective size through appropriate padding implementation
## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Criteria
- The application shall load completely within 1 second on mid-range mobile devices (2023 benchmarks) with 3G network conditions
- All user interactions (task addition, completion, deletion) shall respond within 300ms with visual feedback
- The task list shall maintain 60fps during scrolling operations with up to 100 tasks
- localStorage operations shall complete within 50ms to prevent UI thread blocking

### Usability Standards
- First-time users shall accomplish core tasks (add/complete/delete) without instruction within 15 seconds of initial load
- The application shall maintain a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of ≥ 85 through intuitive interaction patterns
- All primary actions shall be discoverable within two visual layers (no hidden menus or gestures)
- Error prevention shall be prioritized over error recovery (e.g., no confirmation dialogs for deletions)

### Accessibility Compliance
- Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance shall be maintained across all user flows
- Keyboard navigation shall support complete task management without mouse dependency
- Screen reader experience shall achieve 100% task operability with VoiceOver (iOS), TalkBack (Android), and NVDA (Windows)
- Motion preferences (prefers-reduced-motion) shall be respected in all animations

### Technical Constraints
- The application shall function identically across Chrome 115+, Firefox 115+, and Safari 16.4+ without polyfills
- Total payload size shall remain under 50KB (gzipped) to ensure fast loading on constrained networks
- localStorage usage shall not exceed 2MB capacity with 100+ tasks while maintaining performance
- The application shall degrade gracefully in browsers without localStorage support (display read-only task list)

### Reliability Metrics
- Data persistence shall survive 100+ consecutive page refreshes without corruption
- Task operations shall maintain 99.9% success rate during normal usage patterns
- The application shall recover gracefully from localStorage quota exceeded errors
- No data loss shall occur during unexpected browser termination
## 6. Acceptance Criteria

### Task Creation
- **Given** the application is loaded, **when** a user enters "Buy groceries" in the input field and clicks "Add", **then** the task appears in the pending list within 300ms with completion/deletion controls visible
- **Given** an empty input field, **when** the user clicks "Add", **then** no task is created and the input field remains focused for immediate re-entry
- **Given** a newly added task, **when** the page is refreshed, **then** the task remains visible in the pending list with all functionality intact

### Task Completion
- **Given** a pending task in the list, **when** the user clicks the completion toggle (✓), **then** the task immediately displays strikethrough styling with 60% opacity while maintaining its position in the chronological list
- **Given** a completed task, **when** the user clicks the completion toggle again, **then** the task returns to active state with full opacity and no strikethrough within 100ms
- **Given** a completed task, **when** the page is refreshed, **then** the task maintains its completed visual state without requiring re-authentication

### Task Deletion
- **Given** any task in the list, **when** the user clicks the delete control (×), **then** the task immediately disappears from the UI with a subtle scale-down animation (100ms duration)
- **Given** a deleted task, **when** the page is refreshed, **then** the task does not reappear in any section of the task list
- **Given** multiple tasks in the list, **when** a user deletes one task, **then** the remaining tasks maintain their relative positions without reordering

### Data Persistence
- **Given** any task operation (add/complete/delete), **when** the user closes and reopens the browser, **then** all task states are restored exactly as left without manual save actions
- **Given** 50+ tasks in various states, **when** the user performs sequential operations, **then** localStorage updates complete within 50ms without UI freezing or data corruption
- **Given** localStorage at maximum capacity, **when** the user attempts to add a new task, **then** the application displays a non-intrusive warning while maintaining all existing functionality

### State Management
- **Given** multiple pending tasks, **when** the user completes one task, **then** it visually transitions to the completed section while maintaining its original position relative to other completed tasks
- **Given** a mix of pending and completed tasks, **when** the user adds a new task, **then** it appears at the top of the pending section while all completed tasks remain visually grouped below
- **Given** completed tasks exceeding viewport height, **when** the user scrolls, **then** the completed tasks section maintains smooth 60fps performance without layout shifts
