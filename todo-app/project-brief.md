# Project Brief: Simple To-Do List Application

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Title:** Simple To-Do List Application  
**Project Goal:** Develop a single-page web application allowing users to manage tasks with core functionalities (add, complete, delete) and localStorage persistence, all within a single HTML file.

## 2. Key Features
- **Task Addition:** Input field and button to add new tasks to the list
- **Task Display:** Clear visual distinction between pending/completed tasks in a scrollable list
- **Task Completion:** Toggle mechanism to mark tasks as complete with strikethrough styling
- **Task Deletion:** Individual delete buttons for permanent task removal
- **Data Persistence:** Automatic saving to localStorage with no manual save actions required

## 3. Technical Specifications
- **File Structure:** Single `index.html` containing all components
- **Styling:** Internal `<style>` tag using CSS Flexbox/Grid for responsive layout
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript in `<script>` tag handling DOM manipulation and localStorage operations
- **Design Requirements:** 
  - Mobile-first responsive layout (works on 320px+ screen widths)
  - Accessible color contrast (minimum 4.5:1)
  - Semantic HTML5 elements
  - No external dependencies or CDNs

## 4. User Flow
1. **Initial Load:** User opens application → sees empty task list and input field
2. **Adding Task:** 
   - User types task in input field 
   - Clicks "Add" button 
   - Task appears in list with completion/deletion controls
3. **Task Management:**
   - Click "✓" to mark complete (visual strikethrough applied)
   - Click "×" to delete task (immediate removal)
4. **Persistence:** 
   - All changes automatically saved to localStorage
   - Tasks persist through page refreshes and browser restarts

## 5. Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Task categorization (Work/Personal/etc.)
- Due date tracking with calendar integration
- Priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Export functionality (JSON/CSV)
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Cross-device sync via cloud storage
