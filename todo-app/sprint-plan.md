### Sprint Schedule (1-Week Sprints)

| Sprint | Goal | Stories | Business Value |
|--------|------|---------|----------------|
| **Sprint 1** | MVP Foundation | S-001, S-002, S-003 | Enables core task management (70% of PRD value) |
| **Sprint 2** | Data Reliability | S-004, S-005 | Solves critical persistence requirement (20% value) |
| **Sprint 3** | Quality Attributes | S-006, S-007 | Meets accessibility/compliance requirements (10% value) |

## 2. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition

**V1.0 Scope** = Sprints 1-2 deliverables:
- Complete task lifecycle (add/complete/delete)
- localStorage persistence meeting all PRD reliability metrics
- Basic accessibility compliance (keyboard navigation, ARIA)
- Mobile-responsive layout meeting PRD constraints

**MVP Validation Criteria**:
1. All PRD acceptance criteria (sections 6.1-6.4) pass automated verification
2. Payload size < 50KB (gzipped) verified via Lighthouse
3. SUS score ≥ 85 in usability testing with 5 target users
4. Zero critical defects in cross-browser testing matrix

*Why this ensures MVP delivery*: The architecture's vertical slicing allows delivering fully functional business value in Sprint 1 (core task management), with Sprint 2 adding the persistence layer that addresses the primary business problem of task abandonment. This follows the PRD's "just-in-time" interaction model while meeting all critical success factors.

## 3. Risk Analysis & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **localStorage quota limitations** | High | Critical | • Implement atomic writes with error boundaries<br>• Add storage monitoring service<br>• Design fallback to session storage | Dev Team |
| **Cross-browser inconsistencies** | Medium | High | • Target only PRD-specified browsers (Chrome 115+, FF 115+, Safari 16.4+)<br>• Implement feature detection for CSS Grid<br>• Use progressive enhancement pattern | Dev Team |
| **Performance degradation with 100+ tasks** | Medium | Medium | • Virtual scrolling implementation<br>• Debounced localStorage writes (50ms)<br>• Pure function state transformations | Dev Team |
| **Accessibility compliance gaps** | Low | High | • axe-core integration in CI pipeline<br>• Manual testing with NVDA/JAWS<br>• Contrast ratio verification tooling | QA Team |
| **Scope creep from "simple" requirements** | High | Medium | • Strict adherence to PRD exclusion list<br>• Feature flagging for future enhancements<br>• Product Owner gatekeeping at refinement | Product Owner |

## 4. Tailored Agile Practices

### Ceremonies
- **Daily Stand-ups (15 mins)**: Focused on PRD alignment:  
  *"How does today's work advance our PRD acceptance criteria?"*
  
- **Sprint Planning**:  
  • Prioritize stories using *business value vs effort* matrix  
  • Validate story acceptance criteria against PRD section numbers  
  • Allocate 20% capacity for architecture debt (BmAD principle)

- **Sprint Review**:  
  • Demo must include verification against PRD metrics (e.g., "Show 300ms task addition")  
  • Product Owner validates against architecture.md decision records

- **Retrospective**:  
  • Focus on BmAD metrics:  
    - Business value delivered vs planned  
    - Model fidelity (architecture.md vs implementation)  
    - Agile principle adherence

### Artifacts
- **Product Backlog**:  
  • Stories tagged with PRD section references (e.g., "PRD: 3.2")  
  • Architecture.md decision IDs for technical stories (e.g., "ARCH: 3.2")

- **Sprint Backlog**:  
  • Visualized as Kanban board with PRD requirement columns:  
    `PRD 3.1 → PRD 3.2 → PRD 3.4`

- **Definition of Done**:  
  1. PRD acceptance criteria verified  
  2. Architecture.md patterns implemented  
  3. Performance metrics met (Lighthouse report)  
  4. Accessibility audit passed (axe-core)  
  5. Documentation updated in architecture.md

### BmAD-Specific Adaptations
- **Model Validation Checkpoints**:  
  After each sprint, verify implementation against architecture.md using:  
  ```bash
  grep -r "TaskManager" src/ | wc -l  # Should match architecture.md expectations
  ```

- **Business Value Tracking**:  
  Map each story to PRD business metrics:  
  | Story | Abandonment Rate Impact | SUS Score Impact |
  |-------|-------------------------|------------------|
  | S-001 | -15% (faster task capture) | +8 points |
  | S-004 | -32% (persistence reliability) | +12 points |

- **Just-in-Time Refinement**:  
  Limit backlog refinement to 2 sprints ahead to maintain focus on business value delivery.

## 5. Sprint 1 Execution Plan

**Goal**: Deliver core task management meeting PRD sections 3.1-3.3

### Week 1 Commitments
| Story | Tasks | Verification |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| S-001 | • Create input field with 44px height<br>• Implement add button with ARIA label<br>• Add empty submission validation | PRD 3.1.1, 4.4.1 |
| S-002 | • Design completion toggle (✓ icon)<br>• Implement strikethrough animation<br>• Add ARIA live region | PRD 3.2.1, 4.3.2 |
| S-003 | • Create delete control (× icon)<br>• Implement scale-down animation<br>• Verify no DOM reordering | PRD 3.3.1, 4.4.4 |

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All stories meet PRD acceptance criteria (section 6.1-6.3)
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score ≥ 95
- [ ] Zero accessibility violations (axe-core)
- [ ] Architecture.md MVC pattern implemented (TaskStore class)

This plan ensures the team delivers maximum business value while maintaining architectural integrity through disciplined application of BmAD principles. The single-file constraint is managed through strict separation of concerns within the HTML structure, with clear component boundaries as defined in architecture.md.
